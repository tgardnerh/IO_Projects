## Motivation
* “Contractor” vs “Employee” is a spectrum rather than a clear distinction
	* eg Uber, Lockheed Martin
* Contracts are not magic, and in practice very difficult to enforce. 
	*Often damages recovered are less than enforcement costs, rendering a contract unenforceable in effect
* Yet, we all have a contract with UC Davis

---
## Motivation II
* Games with private information often have no efficient equilibrium as a one-off, but can be made efficient as a repeated game
* In practice, the difficulty (cost) of a task is often private information to the person attempting the task
	* (anybody who has worked as an RA has been here)

---
## Goal
* Describe contracts as a way to coordinate strategy in a repeated game
* Argue that what I’ve just modeled is employment
* By writing down the strategy of each party, it becomes easy (easier) to see when somebody is defecting, the punishment becomes predictable, and a cooperative equilibrium is easier to maintain

---
## The Model
* The consumer values a unit of the good at 1
* Each period the producer has the opportunity to produce a unit of good for cost c ~U(0,1]
* c is private information
* consumer makes producer a Take it or Leave it offer at the beginning of each period 

---
## The problem
* In a 1-off game, any bargaining mechanism that assigns some surplus to each party will be inefficient.
* Consumer will maximize their surplus by offering p=.5
* Transactions will happen 1/2 the time, with an expected inefficiency of .125
* Expected BS = .25, expected SS = .125

---
## The solution:
* Consumer offers p=> .5  with promise to offer same price next period if the seller produces
* Seller will produce for all costs less than some c* > p, since the promise of a high offer in the future is worth something.
* This is an improvement in welfare for all parties
* This is also basically employment
