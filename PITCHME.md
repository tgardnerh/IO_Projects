## Motivation I
* “Contractor” vs “Employee” is a spectrum 
	* eg Uber, Lockheed Martin
* Contracts are not magic, very difficult to enforce/unenforceable 
* Yet, we all have a contract with UC Davis

---
## Motivation II
* Games with private information often have no efficient equilibrium
* Private information is common in the real world

---
## Goal
* Describe contracts as a way to coordinate strategy in a repeated game
* Argue that what I’ve just modeled is employment

---
## The Model
* The consumer values a unit of the good at 1
* Producer has the opportunity to produce a unit of good for cost $c \sim U[0,1]$
* $c$ is private information
* Consumer makes producer a Take-it-or-Leave-it offer at the beginning of each period 

---
## The problem
* Consumer will maximize their surplus by offering $p=.5$
* Expected BS = .25, expected SS = .125 (.125 inefficiency)

---
## The solution:
* Consumer offers $p=> .5$  with promise to offer same price next period if the seller produces
* Seller will produce for all costs less than some $c^* > p$, since the promise of a high offer in the future is worth something.
* This is an improvement in welfare for all parties
* This is also basically employment
